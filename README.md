# COVID-tweets
A collection of scripts for searching, downloading, and analyzing COVID-related tweets. See the READMEs in the respective folders for specific info on those scripts.

Twitter-API-Scripts are implemented in Node.js using the Axios package to make and process http requests. The dotenv package is used to keep track of environment variables, but those could also be supplied from the command line.
